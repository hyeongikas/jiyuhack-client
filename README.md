## Salhack
Salhack is a Forge mod made by ionar. In 2021, ionar made the decision to leave the project, and as such, Creepy SalHack was born. 

 
## Installation

Jiyuhack is a fabric mod for `1.20.4`. We provide already pre build jar files on our [release page](https://github.com/hyeongikas/jiyuhack-client/releases). To use Jiyuhack,  drop the jar file in your mods folder with Fabric API and launch. Have fun!

**Tip:** You can open the GUI containing all "tweaks" with your ```Left Shift``` at default (You can change that later.)

## Support

If you have a bug or want to suggest a feature raise an issue on Github.

## Info

Some of the code is pasted and proper credits are not given, but atleast it's open source now? :)

Created by `Imperium` and many others. If you have any legal disagreements, please read [this](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice)
