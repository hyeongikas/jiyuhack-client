## Salhack
Salhack is a Forge mod made by ionar. In 2021, ionar made the decision to leave the project, and as such, Creepy SalHack was born. 

 
## Installation

Salhack is a forge mod for `1.12.2`. We provide already pre build jar files on our [release page](https://github.com/CreepyOrb924/creepy-salhack/releases). To use salhack just drop the jar file in your mods folder and start forge. Have fun!

**Tip:** You can open the GUI containing all "tweaks" with your left arrow at default (You can change that later.)

## Support

If you have a bug or want to suggest a feature raise an issue on Github or contact us via our [Discord](https://discord.gg/B8Tx5HYYBm) server.

## Info

Some of the code is pasted and proper credits are not given, but atleast it's open source now? :)

There is no git history because it contains personal info.
